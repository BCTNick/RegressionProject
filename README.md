# Causes of Early School Leaving in the EU: A Quantitative Analysis
This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for a comprehensive study on Early School Leaving (ESL) in the European Union. The project explores the multifaceted nature of ESL and examines the demographic, socio-economic, cultural, and educational factors that contribute to the phenomenon. 

## Overview
Early School Leaving (ESL) is a critical issue in the European Union, with far-reaching social and economic implications. This study delves into the various factors influencing ESL across different regions of the EU. Key findings from the analysis highlight:

- Educational Attainment: The percentage of adults over 25 with at most lower secondary education (amLSE) is the most significant predictor of ESL, underscoring the need for adult education programs and broader educational support systems.
- Science and Technology: Regions with a higher proportion of Human Resources in Science and Technology (HRST) show lower rates of ESL, suggesting that fostering STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) education can be instrumental in reducing dropout rates.
- Population Density: Urban areas with higher population density exhibit higher ESL rates, likely due to urban-specific challenges such as socio-economic disparities and variations in school quality.
- Regional Disparities: Southern European regions show worse performance in ESL rates, reflecting deeper socio-economic and educational challenges compared to other EU regions.
